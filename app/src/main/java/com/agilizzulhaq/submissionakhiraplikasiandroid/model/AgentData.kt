Under Brimstone's leadership, the organization grew ever larger, recruiting more agents from across the globe as they worked to stop agents from the alternate-dimension Omega Earth from stealing radianite from Alpha. While operations were mostly successful and initially kept heavily compartmentalized even between agents, the failure of one particular mission in Venice and the catastrophe that occurred as a result caused VALORANT to reconsider its approach, moving forward with agents all getting to know one another and being assigned on strike teams together. All this time, Brimstone's position has left him with more of a back-line presence, but life behind a desk has never been of interest to him, and he will still make sure to be present in the field from time to time.\n" +

When two of the Protocol's latest recruits arrived having recently been involved with a Kingdom project called Landfall, Brimstone wasn't ready to make an enemy out of Kingdom, adamant that all they did was for their mission to make the world better and safer, despite growing concerns about what exactly Kingdom was up to. But when it was discovered that the corporation was using a portal to access the interverse and that doing so risked a major radivore invasion, Brimstone was left with no choice but to have it shut down. Initially unable to convince ex-colleagues of the imminent danger and the need for Landfall to be abandoned, Brimstone then personally led a mission straight to the facility in Los Angeles where the portal was located, and the Protocol shut it down for good.\n" +

Brimstone himself had also had to fight against his former employer, after all the years he had spent believing in their vision, making him feel as if he had betrayed them with his actions against them. But, just as Brimstone looks out for his team of agents, so too are they looking out for him. With the support of colleagues both new and old, Brimstone now looks to pick up the pieces from Landfall's demise, and he now has a renewed focus on what needs to come next.

Her team had also arrived at The Vault to find it empty and with hardly any power left, and on entering Containment they had discovered the radivore had broken out of its enclosure, right before it then attacked them, killing her fellow Ståljeger comrades and the Landfall scientist in quick succession. With one nearby chamber still operational, Iselin was able to lure the radivore into it. As she attempted to confine it within though whilst the chamber powered up, the bear forced its head between the closing doors, biting down onto her left arm and holding it in its jaws. From that bite, substances from the radivore's body entered Iselin's own system, causing her to become disoriented and hear an echoing voice, before the sound of a gunshot broke her out of her state of delirium. The scientist, in his final living moment while dying on the ground, had fired a shot at the radivore before collapsing. With the chamber now fully powered up, Iselin activated it to produce a surge of energy that filled the chamber and burst through the gap between the doors, obliterating both the radivore and the arm trapped in its jaws.
